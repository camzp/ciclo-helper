# flutter_listview

A simple Flutter application that demonstrates how to implement a listview.

A ListView widget is populated with a list of Items. The Floating Action Button calls a method to add a new item to the list. The ListView is implemented in a StateFul widget so when a new item is added to the list, the ListView is updated.
